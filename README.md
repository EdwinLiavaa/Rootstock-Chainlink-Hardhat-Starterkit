As a [Chainlink Developer Expert](https://chain.link/developers/experts), I'm excited to share my exploration of a groundbreaking integration that unifies Bitcoin's robust security, Ethereum's smart contract functionality, and real-world data through Chainlink's decentralized oracle network (DON). 

This project focuses on building hybrid smart contracts by combining Rootstock (RSK), which inherits Bitcoin's security through merge-mining while maintaining full EVM compatibility, with Chainlink's oracle services, all orchestrated through the Hardhat development framework. 

For developers looking to follow along, you'll need Node.js (specifically version 18.0.0) with nvm, Hardhat, a working knowledge of Solidity and JavaScript/TypeScript, and a Metamask wallet configured for the Rootstock network with some test RBTC.
